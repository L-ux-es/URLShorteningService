### üìñ API Documentation

This project uses **Swagger** to document the REST API built with Spring Boot.  
Once the application is running, you can access the Swagger UI at:
http://localhost:8095/swagger-ui.html

## üöÄ Usage

Follow these steps to run the application locally:

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/L-ux-es/URLShorteningService.git
   cd URLShorteningService

2. Define the required variables at [.env](.env) file

Below are the environment variables you can define in the `.env` file to configure the application:

| Variable      | Description                                                                         |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `DB_URL`      | Full database connection URL (including host, port, database name, and parameters). |
| `DB_NAME`     | Name of the database to be used.                                                    |
| `DB_USERNAME` | Username to access the database.                                                    |

3. Build the project with Maven

```bash
mvn clean install
````

4. Run the application

```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```
